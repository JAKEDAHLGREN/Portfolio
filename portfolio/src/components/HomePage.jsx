						My name is Jake Dahlgren and I am a full-stack developer with a
						passion for creative problem-solving and building new things. I come
						from a unique background in Orthotic and Prosthetic fabrication,
						where I honed my skills designing and creating medical devices that
						helped improve our patient's lives. My experience in this field
						taught me the importance of communication, attention to detail and
						the value collaboration.
					</p>

					<p className="p2">
						I am a creative individual who enjoys exploring different forms of
						art and expressing myself through various mediums. I believe that
						the skills I have gained through visual arts will be an asset to me
						as I enter my next chapter as a Web Developer. My goal is to use my
						creativity to help design visually pleasing products that place a
						high value on the users experience.
					</p>

					<p className="p3">
						I am excited about my transition into tech and look forward to
						applying my skills and experience in new and challenging ways. My
						familiarity with team collaboration will enable me to work
						effectively with other developers, designers, and clients to create
						a beautiful and functional product that meets the needs of the
						business and their users.
					</p>

					<p className="p4">
						Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward
						to connecting with you and discussing how we can work together in
						the future!
